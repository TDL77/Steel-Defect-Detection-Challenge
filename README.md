With the help of machine learning and computer vision, it is possible to detect the defects in steel with the use of some of the annotated examples of images where there are defects. Therefore, this could save a lot of time and effort when there is no need to use human aid in the detection, therefore speeding up the process of detecting the defects in steel. It would surely increase the value that it gives to the companies if they are able to detect the defects in steel early before giving those to different constructors. As a result, the construction industry would thrive in the process as a result of using machine learning and deep learning.

Since we are going to be dealing with images, the problem at hand is a Computer Vision Problem. In this project, Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) were used in the process of prediction of defects in the steel. Hyperparameter tuning was done to ensure that proper machine learning insights are generated. We would be first converting those images into the form of vectors so that we are able to give to the machine learning models for prediction respectively. 

Let us now go over the project and get a good understanding of the important components respectively. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository.  
3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 
4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository. 
5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 
6. Once downloaded, you might use the jupyter notebook to run the .ipynb files or other navigators to open this file.
