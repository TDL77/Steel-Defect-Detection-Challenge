# Steel-Defect-Detection-Challenge

With the help of machine learning and computer vision, it is possible to detect the defects in steel with the use of some of the annotated examples of images where there are defects. Therefore, this could save a lot of time and effort when there is no need to use human aid in the detection, therefore speeding up the process of detecting the defects in steel. 

We would be first converting those images into the form of vectors so that we are able to give to the machine learning models for prediction respectively.
