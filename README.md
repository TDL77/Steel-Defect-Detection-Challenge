# ðŸ¥„ Steel Defect Detection

With the help of machine learning and computer vision, it is possible to detect the defects in steel with the use of some of the annotated examples of images where there are defects. Therefore, this could save a lot of time and effort when there is no need to use human aid in the detection, therefore speeding up the process of detecting the defects in steel. It would surely increase the value that it gives to the companies if they are able to detect the defects in steel early before giving those to different constructors. As a result, the construction industry would thrive in the process as a result of using machine learning and deep learning.

Since we are going to be dealing with images, the problem at hand is a Computer Vision Problem. In this project, Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) were used in the process of prediction of defects in the steel. Hyperparameter tuning was done to ensure that proper machine learning insights are generated. We would be first converting those images into the form of vectors so that we are able to give to the machine learning models for prediction respectively. 

Let us now go over the project and get a good understanding of the important components respectively. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once the Git is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to add the files or the repository.
3. You'll have to click on "Gitbash here" that would be opened when you right click on a particular location.
One the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then copy the clipboard file that is present when you click on Code in Github. 
4. The link must be pasted and run so that the files would be downloaded at the location of interest. Later, you'll need to use Anaconda Prompt and add "Jupyter notebook" in the prompt.
5. This would open the jupyter notebook that could be used to run and load the .ipynb files respectively. Therefore, you would be able to run the project at hand.
